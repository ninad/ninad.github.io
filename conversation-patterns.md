## Patterns of conversations

These are some common conversational events that happen over and over at a work place. Below are some good patterns on how to reduce friction in these events. these are just based on my personal experience and feeling. no scientific evidence. Just observation and experience.

### 1. Asking a question

If you get a bad answer, most often there is something wrong in the question. Elements of a good question are:

Includes context or a topic
Includes a clear demand
Is specific and narrow
Ordered in in a way the information is stored in the persons mind
✅ Good Example:

> When is feature x going to be released?

_Specific, narrow, to the point, makes a demand_

⛔️ Bad Example:

> Next product release is on the 10th?

_Generic, more of a statement than a question_
