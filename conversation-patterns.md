## Scope

There are lots of different opportunities for us to communicate in our daily lives. This essay is about Chat, Email and In-person communications at work.

## Patterns of conversations

These are some common conversational events that happen over and over at a work place. Below are some good patterns on how to reduce friction in these events. these are just based on my personal experience and feeling. no scientific evidence. Just observation and experience.

### 1. Asking a question

If you get a bad answer, most often there is something wrong in the question. Elements of a good question are:

* Includes context or a topic
* Includes a clear demand
* Is specific and narrow
* Ordered in in a way the information is stored in the persons mind

‚úÖ Good Example:

Example | Comment 
- | -
**`When is feature x going to be released?`** | *Specific, narrow, to the point, makes a demand*

‚õîÔ∏è Bad Example:

Example | Comment 
- | -
**`WhenNext product release is on the 10th??`** | *Generic, more of a statement than a question*

### 2. Answering a question

Within the context or topic of the question
To the point of the demand
Any other information needed to add more value to the answer
3. Asking for an update

### A brief history of communication

We‚Äôve evolved from speaking to drawing to writing with the advent of technology, starting from texting and then internet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwriting has evolved significantly. In fact language has been attributed to our survival against other homo species the Neanderthal,

Studies show that writing was only invented 5,500 years ago, whereas language probably traces back at least 80,000 years. Talking came first, and writing developed later. Earliest examples show that writing was first based on the way people speak, in short sentences. However, while talk is largely subconscious and rapid, writing is deliberate and slow.

texting has become more popular than ever. not just in personal context, but also in business contexts. it is the most natural form on conversation after in person conversation. it is closest to in person conversation without the need for being present. Which allows for semi-async short conversations. no wonder than it has become immensely popular texting is more personal than writing, can communicate personality and empathy. It is more in the moment
